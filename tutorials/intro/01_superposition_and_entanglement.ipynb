    "Quantum computing can be a bit daunting at first, but the rest of this notebook should help give you a basic understanding of the math behind quantum computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand these programs, and quantum computers in general, it is simpler to start with something familiar, everyday classical computers, and work our way up from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What is a computer?**\n",
    "A device which stores information (bits), and changes that information by following a set of rules (computation) to do something clever or useful.\n",

    "\n",
    "Bits represent differences at the simplest level by enhabiting one of two possibilites: this or that, left or right, on or off, etc. A bit is a \"two state system\" and can represent any two things, states, or classes.\n",

    "Typically we will see bits representing states like:\n",

    "\n",
